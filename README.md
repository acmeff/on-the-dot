#On The Dot

##About

[On the Dot][gamewright] is a pattern-matching board game that usually supports 1-4 players. This implementation will be a solitaire version.

Game play: At the beginning of each round, the player is shown a square card with a pattern of colored dots. They will also receive four transparent cards that each have four dots (one green, one red, one blue, one yellow). The goal of the game is to manipulate the transparent cards (by flipping or rotating) and stack them on top of each other until they match the original pattern that was given at the beginning of the round.
