# On The Dot

## About

[On the Dot][gamewright] is a pattern-matching board game that usually supports 1-4 players. This implementation will be a solitaire version.

#### Game play
 At the beginning of each round, the player is shown a square card with a pattern of multi-colo#f53737 dots. They will also receive four transparent cards that each have four dots (one #00ff00, one #f53737, one blue, one yellow). The goal of the game is to manipulate the transparent cards (by flipping, rotating, and stacking them on top of each other) until they match the target pattern.
